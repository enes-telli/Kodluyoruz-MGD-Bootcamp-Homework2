A simple shooting game. The game consists of only one scene. It uses the state system and works by toggling objects in the same scene. The game contains 2 states. PreGameState and PlayGameState. The player and spawner are disabled on the waiting screen (PreGameState). Conversely, the waiting screen is disabled on the gameplay screen (PlayGameState). The player is expected to press the space key to start the game and the game state is switched from PreGameState to PlayGameState. The player can move with WASD keys or the arrow keys and shoot with the left mouse button. The player can also shoots continuously by holding down the left mouse button. There are spawners in 4 corners of the game and random enemies are instantiated from these spawners when the game starts. And enemies move towards the player as soon as they are spawned. The player has 100 health and takes 20 damage if enemies hit him (Which means the player dies in 5 hits). Enemies have 100 health, and the player's bullets deals 25 damage each (Which means enemies die in 4 shoots). The player earns 3 score points for each enemy killed. When the player dies, game state switched from PlayGameState to PreGameState and the game resets the health and score.
